Introduction and Scope of the project.
49er Delivers is a project that aims to design a fully normalized database
system. This database will be used to keep tack of a food delivery application
for UNC Charlotte. There will be data related to 10 different restaurants from
which users can order.

The scope of this project is limited to keeping track of the list of restaurants
available, the menu of each restaurant including item price, delivery points,
payment options, user data and preferences, employee data, relationship to
UNC Charlotte and delivery personnel information which includes plate number
and vehicle model and color.

For each order placed there will be a $5.00. With only one customer tied to the
order. There will be no need to itemize the invoice, just the total price and
delivery charge. The order will also contain driver info and delivery items.
A unique identifier will be assigned to each restaurant, and the identifier will
be indicated on the order.
